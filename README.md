# ActivityApp4


This commit represents a significant milestone in the development of my Android app built with MAUI (Multi-platform App UI). The purpose of this commit is to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing courses and students within the app.

The code contained within this commit introduces a robust and user-friendly functionality, allowing users to seamlessly add, edit, delete, and view both courses and students. By incorporating SQLite as the local database, the app ensures data persistence and efficient retrieval for offline usage.

The commit includes the implementation of dedicated ViewModel classes, enabling separation of concerns and maintaining a clean MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. ViewModel classes handle the business logic for managing courses and students, utilizing the data models to represent the course and student entities.

A series of intuitive buttons on the main page of the app provides users with quick access to essential features such as adding new courses and students. The app also includes a search functionality, allowing users to search for specific students by name.

This commit marks a significant achievement in building a comprehensive Android app capable of efficiently managing courses and students, making it a versatile tool for educational institutions, instructors, and students alike. The thoughtful inclusion of CRUD operations ensures a smooth and seamless user experience, further enhancing the app's utility and appeal. With the groundwork laid, the app is now primed for future enhancements, making it an exciting prospect for further development and expansion.
